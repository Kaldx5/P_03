## Selecting Components

**Step 1: Choosing the Best Microcontroller**

The microcontroller should offer:
- **Low power consumption.**
- **Built-in connectivity** (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for notifications).
- **Small form factor.**

### Option 1: **ESP32**
**Why ESP32?**
- **Integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth**: Ideal for sending notifications wirelessly.
- **Dual-core processor**: Provides more processing power with fewer components.
- **Multiple GPIO pins**: To handle sensors, lasers, and other components.
- **Low power consumption** with deep sleep modes.

### Option 2: **STM32 (For more hardware control)**
**Why STM32?**
- Offers **high performance**, widely used in professional embedded systems.
- Works with **fewer components** and has a wide range of peripherals.

## Ordering the Components

**Microcontroller Options:**

- **ESP32-WROOM ESP32s Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Module (38 Pin)**
    - Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless notifications.
    - 38 pins offer flexibility for connecting sensors (laser, photodiode), LEDs, and other components.
    - Compatible with C/C++ (via ESP-IDF or Arduino IDE) and MicroPython for programming.

- **STM32F103C8T6 ARM Cortex M3 (Bluepill)**
    - Great for low-power, high-performance applications.
    - Can be paired with an **ESP8266** to handle communication (Wi-Fi), while the STM32 handles processing.
    - However, interfacing two microcontrollers adds complexity.

### Best Approach:
- **Option 1:** Stick with ESP32 for both processing and communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) to minimize components.
- **Option 2:**  
  A. Use STM32 for powerful processing and ESP8266 for Wi-Fi.  
  B. Handle laser detection locally with STM32 and explore GSM or 433 MHz RF modules for simple wireless communication without Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.

### Conclusion:
The **ESP32-WROOM ESP32s (38 Pin)** module is the most powerful and simplifies the project significantly by handling both the laser detection and notification functionalities with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

## Current Progress

### Code Development

At the moment, I am working on:
- **Implementing notifications using Blynk on ESP32.**
- **Understanding virtual pins and how they map to the ESP32's pins.** This is crucial for setting up the virtual pins for triggering notifications when the laser line is interrupted.
- **Setting up Wi-Fi connectivity and event-driven notifications** using Blynk, ensuring that when the laser line is crossed, a message is sent to the connected device.
  
I am also diving into concepts like:
- **Event-driven programming:** Understanding how to use Blynk's virtual pins for dynamic notifications.
- **ESP32 power modes:** Ensuring the device can run efficiently with low power consumption.

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Notification System**  
   Fine-tune the Blynk notification system and ensure reliable communication when the laser line is interrupted. If Blynk doesn't suffice, I will explore alternatives like **IFTTT** or **Telegram notifications** for more robust and customizable alert systems.

2. **Optimize the Laser Detection Circuit**  
   Calibrate the laser and photodiode/LDR system to ensure accurate and fast detection of any interruption.

3. **Power Optimization**  
   Explore power-saving techniques using the ESP32's deep sleep modes to extend battery life.

4. **Local Notifications**  
   Implement a buzzer or LED alert system for immediate feedback when the laser line is interrupted.

## Future Ideas and Development

- **Multiple Laser Lines:**
    - Expand the system to handle multiple laser lines, each monitoring a different zone. This can increase the security coverage of the device.
  
- **Cloud Integration:**
    - Integrate with **cloud platforms** for logging and storing events, making it easier to track how often the laser line is interrupted over time.
  
- **AI for Intrusion Detection:**
    - Use **machine learning algorithms** to distinguish between different types of intrusions (e.g., small objects vs. large objects) to minimize false alarms.
  
- **Mobile App:**
    - Develop a dedicated mobile app for real-time notifications and controlling the system remotely, possibly using frameworks like **Flutter** or **React Native**.

- **Portable Design:**
    - Make the device smaller and more portable, possibly using a 3D-printed case to house all components, making it easier to deploy in various locations.

## How It Works

- The ESP32 continuously monitors the laser line using a photodiode or LDR.
- When the laser is interrupted (i.e., an object crosses the line), the ESP32 sends a notification (via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) and activates local alerts like a buzzer or LED.

## Conclusion

Project-03 is designed to be a compact, efficient, and highly functional laser security system with future development plans. The use of ESP32 simplifies the design while allowing for robust notifications via Wi-Fi. With further optimizations and features in mind, this project has the potential to evolve into a fully-featured security system.
